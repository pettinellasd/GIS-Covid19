<h3 align="center">Quick understanding visualization without a manual daily update</h3>

My work on Covid19 mapping rests on three pillars:
- Constantly updated (without the need for code intervention)
- Use within everyone's reach
- Comprehensive in data entry

To do this we have chosen as:
- Work environment, the Windows operating system (as the most popular)
- Python programming language, which is well suited to both GIS and data science operations
- Jupiter interpreter, to view the work both at the end and in the middle of the code


What you will find:

Thanks to the implementation of the Folium library and its most intrinsic features viewing the data is simple and rather intuitive.
In addition, the use of choropletic maps combined with the options in the drop-down menu makes it faster to observe the differences between areas.

The resulting graphics have been designed for a mass audience, so that a reading of them can remain exhaustive and satisfy the most common and frequent questions, ergo not all the data made available by the ministry and civil protection are necessarily to be included in those maps

One year after the drafting of this project I can say that the strategy of obtaining maps that update themselves, thus making the code as autonomous as possible and excluded from daily alterations in order to lower the costs of the service, has been achieved.
The changes (in a year) related to the data were minimal: they only affect the graphical display of two regions. An "easy-to-repaire" job with pandas.
