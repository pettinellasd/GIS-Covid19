- 👋 Hi, I’m Simon Danny Pettinella, I live in Italy but I always keep my horizons far away!
- 👀 I’m interested in so many things, I've so many passions and among them there is the data science
- 🎓 I've a bachelor in business and management and I have a master degree in applied data science
- 💞️ Yeah, I like looking at data, observing the markets, making precise pictures of what is happening around me
- 🌱 I’m always learning Python, R, Matlab... 'cause there are always news: new versions, new libraries, new potentials!
- 📫 If you want to get in touch with me, don't hesitate: I like to exchange opinions, talk about business, discuss data science
Write to: pettinellasd@gmail.com or find me on FB or Insta: with the name they gave me I think you will find me quite easily 😂
